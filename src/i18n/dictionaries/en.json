      {
        "question": "Is Benadryl safe for dogs?",
        "answer": "Yes, Benadryl (diphenhydramine) is generally safe for dogs when given at the correct dosage of 1 mg per pound of body weight. However, you should avoid giving Benadryl to dogs with glaucoma, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, or pregnant/nursing dogs. Always consult your veterinarian before giving any medication."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much Benadryl can I give my dog?",
        "answer": "The standard Benadryl dosage for dogs is 1 mg per pound of body weight, given 2-3 times daily (every 8-12 hours). For example, a 25-pound dog can take 25 mg of Benadryl. Never exceed 2 mg per pound in a single dose. Use our calculator above for accurate dosing."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does Benadryl do for dogs?",
        "answer": "Benadryl is an antihistamine that helps relieve allergy symptoms in dogs, including itching, hives, swelling, and sneezing. It can also help with motion sickness, mild anxiety, and reactions to insect bites or stings. The active ingredient diphenhydramine blocks histamine receptors."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can dogs take Benadryl for allergies?",
        "answer": "Yes, dogs can take Benadryl for allergies. It effectively treats seasonal allergies, environmental allergens, food allergies (symptoms only), and allergic reactions causing itchy skin or hives. Give the standard dose of 1 mg per pound of body weight every 8-12 hours."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can dogs take Benadryl for itching?",
        "answer": "Yes, Benadryl can help relieve itching in dogs caused by allergies, insect bites, or skin irritation. The antihistamine properties reduce the histamine response that causes itching. For best results, give 1 mg per pound of body weight every 8-12 hours until symptoms improve."
      },
      {
        "question": "What type of Benadryl is safe for dogs?",
        "answer": "Only use Benadryl products containing diphenhydramine as the ONLY active ingredient. Avoid Benadryl-D (contains decongestants), multi-symptom formulas, and any product containing xylitol (toxic to dogs). Regular Benadryl tablets (25mg) or children's liquid Benadryl (12.5mg/5mL) are safe options."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I give my dog Benadryl every day?",
        "answer": "While Benadryl is generally safe for short-term use, daily long-term use should only be done under veterinary supervision. Prolonged use may require dosage adjustments or alternative treatments. For chronic allergies, your vet may recommend prescription medications instead."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does Benadryl take to work in dogs?",
        "answer": "Benadryl typically starts working within 30 minutes and reaches peak effectiveness in 1-2 hours. The effects usually last 8-12 hours. For motion sickness or travel anxiety, give Benadryl 30 minutes before the car ride or trip."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use children's Benadryl for my dog?",
        "answer": "Yes, children's liquid Benadryl (12.5mg per 5mL) is often easier to dose for smaller dogs. However, check ingredients carefully - avoid any formula containing xylitol (toxic to dogs), alcohol, or additional active ingredients beyond diphenhydramine."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if I give my dog too much Benadryl?",
        "answer": "If you suspect a Benadryl overdose, contact your veterinarian or the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center (888-426-4435) immediately. Signs of overdose include extreme drowsiness, seizures, rapid heartbeat, difficulty breathing, agitation, and dilated pupils."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Benadryl the same as diphenhydramine?",
        "answer": "Yes, Benadryl is a brand name for the antihistamine diphenhydramine. Generic diphenhydramine works identically and is often more affordable. Whether using brand-name Benadryl or generic diphenhydramine, always verify it's the only active ingredient."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much Benadryl can I give my 50 lb dog?",
        "answer": "A 50-pound dog can take 50 mg of Benadryl (two 25mg tablets) every 8-12 hours. This follows the standard dosage of 1 mg per pound of body weight. Do not exceed 100 mg per dose (2 mg per pound maximum)."
